Initially a straight-up port of the old Perl [ISS-RT tools](https://github.com/kraigu/ISS-RT) to Python.

Requires the [python-rt module](https://gitlab.labs.nic.cz/labs/python-rt). Built and tested against 1.0.9.

Requires a .rtrcp file in your home directory as such:

```
[rt]
username=yourusername
hostname=yourrtinstance
password=guessme
```
